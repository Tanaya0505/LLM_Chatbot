## Overview

This repository contains a chatbot designed to enhance user interaction and data analysis in the areas of **Health**, **Productivity**, and **Fitness**. The chatbot leverages **Langchainâ€™s language models** to generate intelligent, context-aware prompts, making it easier for users to navigate and interpret data. The intuitive **Streamlit** interface allows users to interact with the chatbot, ask questions, and receive personalized app recommendations.

## Features

- **Intelligent Prompt Generation:** Uses Langchain to generate relevant prompts that guide data exploration.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit, offering a seamless experience for querying and visualizing data.
- **Targeted Recommendations:** Provides app suggestions based on user input, tailored to Health, Productivity, and Fitness categories.

## Data Acquisition

### Web Scraping

The chatbot collects app data using the **Google Play Scraper** library. It gathers information such as:

- App title
- User score
- Number of ratings
- Ads presence
- Price and whether it's free
- Install numbers
- Release date
- In-app product prices
- App icon

The data is organized into dataframes by category, enabling in-depth analysis of app performance and user feedback.

## Data Storage

### Amazon S3

All collected data is stored securely in **Amazon S3**, using the **boto3** library for authentication. This setup supports data archiving, backup, and collaboration, ensuring that the data is both secure and easily accessible.

## Model Architecture

### 1. Langchain Framework

- **Langchain** serves as the main framework, integrating the language models, data processing agents, and user interface.

### 2. Chat Model: ChatOpenAI

- The chatbot uses **ChatOpenAI** to generate responses based on user inputs, leveraging advanced NLP techniques to ensure accurate and engaging interactions.

### 3. Data Processing Agent: pandas_dataframe_agent

- Data management is handled by **pandas_dataframe_agent**, which uses the **pandas** library to clean, transform, and organize the data for optimal analysis.

### 4. Language Model: GPT-4

- **GPT-4** is the core language model, responsible for understanding user queries and generating human-like responses.
